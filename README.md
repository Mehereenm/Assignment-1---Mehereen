# Project proposal - Mehereen Meem 

We can create a blog platform with features such as:

 * Login page
 * Posting function/page for bloggers
 * User profiles 
 * Comments/Replies 
 * Likes

This platform can be used as a way to reach out and connect with audiences, and it's one of the ways to be "visible" or found online. It also serves as a means of  a marketing strategy for many individuals and businesses.

# Who is the primary user?

Primary users for this are small buisness owners, as a means of a marketing strategy and a way to reach out to a larger or diverse audience base.  And also for affiliate advitisers, who use the platform to promote and recommend products with their affiliate links.
